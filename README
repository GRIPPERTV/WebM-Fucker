This project was made after me and my friend saw a WebM that resizes itself in Discord,
so we decided to replicate it

# Patched
It's funny that, after release, them patched, and after a method in Discord's cache,
them patched it again

# Setup
You need to set FFmpeg and ImageMagick's Convert in your environment
FFmpeg: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
ImageMagick: https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php
It's recommended to install via Package Manager on Linux

Downloads with ready setup (Windows only):

# How to use Fucker
> fucker [Input] [Resolutions] (the two arguments are optional)
Fucker resize the images In Images folder, convert to WebM in Frames folder,
and concat every frame into one WebM as Output.webm

If a Audio.aac exists in Workspace, it use this audio

Note #1: Program delete the frames, Audio.aac and Output.web after run
Note #2: In first run, program will create 3 folders: Workspace, Images & Frames

Input: Input video in program's folder, the program will
use this video to create the images, Audio.aac and use it

Example: "fucker Input.mp4", extract images and audio
from Input, and will use the resolutions in second argument.

You can also use this commands to only extract a video's images and audio:
> ffmpeg -i Input.mp4 "Images/Image %05d.png"
> ffmpeg -i Input.mp4 -vn -acodec copy "Workspace/Audio.aac"

Resolutions: The resolutions that will be used
in images, it works in a linear order

Example: "fucker 100x100 200x200", the first image will be 100x100,
the second one be 200x200, and third be 100x100 etc...

You can combine the two arguments, so "Program Input.mp4 100x100 200x200",
make the first Input.mp4's image be 100x100, the second one be 200x200 etc...

# Name Pattern
The program have a "Name Pattern", so you can manually modify a
specific image's resolution without the argument, it only work
when you don't use the Input argument, because this argument
ignores the pattern. To use, just rename the image that you
want with "&WxH" before extension, W = Width & H = Heigth

Example: "ImageName &100x500.png"

# How to use Replace (only Windows):
> replace [X] [Y] [Resolution]
Replace is a program that adds the pattern to the image X to Y
with the resolution, without needing to manually change all images name

Example: "replace 00001 00003 100x100", change the name of the
image 1 to 5 with the name pattern in resolution "100x100"

Tree list example:
Image 00001.png -> Image 00001 &100x100.png
Image 00002.png -> Image 00002 &100x100.png
Image 00003.png -> Image 00003 &100x100.png

Note #4: The program just accept images name that have the zeros in X
Note #5: The zeros in X need to be the same in Y, so you can't
use "00001 00010" because it can bug the program

Program slow? Well, it uses FFmpeg and ImageMagick to do the trick,
but you can open a issue with another better program or library
